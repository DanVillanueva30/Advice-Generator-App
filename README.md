## My process
  First off, I started by analyzing the different designs of the challenge. Then I created the CSS files: normalize.css and styles.css. I continued by creating the CSS variables for the different colors of the project and also added the font that was provided in the style-guide file. Once I finished with the basic setup in the CSS files, I moved to the HTML file. The design was pretty easy, and I didn't have any major trouble with it. The JavaScript part was also easy. I chose to use async/await instead of Promises to work with the API because I think it has a simpler syntax.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned
  It was an easy challenge, but it really helped me to practice everything that I've learned. This is my first project working with an API, and I found it fun! I'll start another project immediately!"
